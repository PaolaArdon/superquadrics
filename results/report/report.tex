\section {Introduction}

\subsection {Code Sprint}
A code sprint is an accelerated research and development program, inspired by the Google Summer of Code model, and organised within the Point Cloud Library project by the host foundation, Open Perception Inc. PCL developers are paired with senior researchers and engineers from various institutions for extended R\&D work with financial backup.

The first code sprint in which Toyota got involved was done in 2012, and one of the projects was that of implementing novel smoothing algorithms \cite{tocs_final_report}.

\subsection {Target}
The target of the current code sprint is that of analysing the possibilities of using superquadric object representation in robotics computer vision tasks such as object detection. 

The structure of this report is as follows. In this section we continue by introducing the concept of superquadrics and some mathematical background, as well as sources of datasets we have used for development. Next, in section \ref{sec:sampling}, we look into techniques for sampling the superquadric equation in order to get point clouds and meshes. Section \ref{sec:fitting} shows the approaches we implemented for fitting superquadric objects into point clouds, with the extension of fully describing a point set as a collection of non-overlapping superquadrics. We then look into how to efficiently find objects for which we now the parametric representation in a new point cloud - section \ref{sec:detection}. Finally, we show a complete demo using an RGB-D sensor in Section \ref{sec:tabletop_demo} and conclude with section \ref{sec:conclusion}.


\subsection {Superquadrics}

\subsubsection*{History}
The concept of superquadrics was first introduced in the Computer Graphics community in \cite{1673799}, as a means of versatile parametric object modelling. The mathematical details have been extended in the work of Jakli\v{c} et al. \cite{SQ_2000}. Just like quadrics, superquadrics can be split into superellipsoids, superhyperboloids of one piece, superhyperboloids of two pieces and supertoroids, but for the purpose of our work, we only focused on superellipsoids (see Figure \ref{fig:superquadric_family}).

\label{fig:superquadric_family}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Definition}
\label{sec:math}
They are created from two two-dimensional curves (a horizontal and a vertical curve) that form a three-dimensional surface under spherical product. For example, a unit sphere is created as the spherical product of a half circle in the plane orthogonal to $(x, y)$ is crossed with the full circle in the $(x, y)$ plane.

\begin{equation}
m (\eta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos {\eta} \\ \sin{\eta} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
h(\omega) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos {\omega} \\ \sin {\omega} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

with $\eta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ and $\omega \in [-\pi, \pi)$.

The sphere becomes:

\begin{equation}
r (\eta, \omega) = m (\eta) \oplus h (\omega) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos{\eta} \cos{\omega} \\ \cos{\eta} \sin{\omega} \\ \sin{\omega} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

A superellipsoid can be obtained by the spherical product of two superellipses of the form:

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon}} + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon}} = 1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
s(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} a \cos^\epsilon{\theta} \\ b \sin^\epsilon {\theta} \end{pmatrix} \textnormal{, with } \theta \in [-\pi, \pi]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
r (\eta, \omega) = s_1 (\eta) \oplus s_2 (\omega) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos^{\epsilon_1} {\eta} \\ a_3 \sin^{\epsilon_1} {\eta} \end{pmatrix} \oplus \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \cos^{\epsilon_2} {\omega} \\ a_2 \sin^{\epsilon_2} {\omega} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \cos^{\epsilon_1} {\eta} \cos^{\epsilon_2} {\omega} \\ a_2 \cos^{\epsilon_1} {\eta} \sin^{\epsilon_2} {\omega} \\ a_3 \sin^{\epsilon_1}{\eta}\end{pmatrix} \textnormal{, with } \eta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2], \omega \in [-\pi, \pi)
\end{equation}

The five parameters of a superellipse are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\textbf{$a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$} - scaling factors along the three axes}
	\item {\textbf{$\epsilon_1$} - the shape of the superellipsoid cross section in a plane orthogonal to the $(x, y)$ plane and containing the $z$-axis}
	\item {\textbf{$\epsilon_2$} - the shape of the superellipsoid cross section parallel to the $(x, y)$ plane}	
\end{itemize}

% TODO Generate superellipsoids with various parameters: vary a,b,c, bigger e1, bigger e2 - 7 figures in total

The implicit equation of a superellipsoid is thus:

\begin{equation}
\left(\left(\frac{x}{a_1}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_2}} + \left(\frac{y}{a_2}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_2}}\right)^{\frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1}} + \left(\frac{z}{a_3}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_1}} =1
\end{equation}

Because of the inside-outside functions that describe superquadrics, they can be easily manipulated by means of solid boolean operations such as union, intersection and subtraction.

\subsubsection*{Numerical Issues}
There are some issues we need to take into consideration when writing code that involves the usage of superquadrics. All the powers in the implicit function are of the form $2p$: $2/\epsilon_1$, $2/\epsilon_2$, and we compute them in the order $x^{(2p)}=(x^2)^p$ so that they are always positive. In the case of the explicit function, all the powers are actually signed power functions, and are treated as follows:

\begin{equation}
x^p = sgn(x) |x|^p = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		|x|^p  & \textnormal{if } x \geq 0 \\
		-|x|^p & \textnormal{if } x < 0
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}


Because of the limitation of the range of real numbers a 64-bit system can compute within, we need to clamp the $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ parameters in the interval $(0.1, 1.9)$. Values beyond this range do not introduce a lot more expressiveness to the objects, but creates numerical problems as $\frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1}$ becomes very large.

\subsection {Datasets}
For the purpose of this work, we gathered data from multiple sources:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Created manually} - using Google Sketchup - Figure \ref {fig:sketchup}}
	\item{\textbf{Trimble 3D Warehouse} - \url{http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/} - Figure \ref {fig:trimble_warehouse}}
	\item{\textbf{Scanned with an RGB-D camera} - multiple frames registered with PCL KinFu - Figure \ref{fig:kinfu_datasets}}
\end{itemize}

\section {Sampling}
\label{sec:sampling}

Sampling superquadrics is important as it allows for easy visualization and for evaluating fitting or registration errors. We have tried multiple ways of doing this, as will be explained in this section.

\subsection {VTK}

Using the Visualization ToolKit library, the code for generating a superquadric centered at the origin is simply:

\begin{verbatim}
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkSuperquadricSource> superquadricSource = 
       vtkSmartPointer<vtkSuperquadricSource>::New();
    superquadricSource->SetPhiRoundness (epsilon_1);
    superquadricSource->SetThetaRoundness (epsilon_2);
    superquadricSource->SetScale (a, b, c);
    superquadricSource->SetPhiResolution (1000);
    superquadricSource->SetThetaResolution (1000);
    superquadricSource->SetSize (1.);
\end{verbatim}

As the code suggests (setting $\phi$ and $\theta$ resolutions), this does nothing but uniformly sample the parameter space for the two angles and generate points using the explicit equation. This source can be then connected to a renderer and used to display the generated mesh - see Figure \ref{fig:sampling_VTK}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\columnwidth]{figures/sampling_VTK_solid}
\hspace {1cm}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\columnwidth]{figures/sampling_VTK_wireframe}
\caption {Superquadric sampling using the VTK library.}
\label{fig:sampling_VTK}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Explicit}

Here, we uniformly sample the two angular parameters of the superquadric, and set the correct mesh connectivity. As with the VTK results, we see that the meshes are not spatially sampled in an uniform way - there are not enough points around the corners and the middle of the shape - see Figure \ref{fig:sampling_explicit}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.25\columnwidth]{figures/sampling_explicit_solid}
\hspace {1cm}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\columnwidth]{figures/sampling_explicit_cloud}
\caption {Superquadric sampling by uniformly sampling the angular parameter space.}
\label{fig:sampling_explicit}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Smart}

much more suitable for computing errors and true distances

superellipse implicit equation

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{x}{a_1}\right)^{2/\epsilon} + \left(\frac{y}{a_2}\right)^{2/\epsilon} = 1
\end{equation}

and explicit
\begin{equation}
x(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \cos(\theta)^\epsilon \\ a_2 \sin(\theta)^\epsilon \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

arclength between two close points $x(\theta)$ and $x (\theta + \Delta_\theta (\theta))$ can be approximated by the euclidean distance between the points:
\begin{equation}
D (\theta) = | x(\theta) - x(\theta + \Delta_\theta(\theta)) |
\end{equation}

$\Delta_\theta(\theta)$ is small, first order approximation:

\begin{equation}
D(\theta)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (a_1 \cos (\theta)^\epsilon) \Delta_\theta (\theta) \right)^2 + 
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (a_2 \sin (\theta)^\epsilon) \Delta_\theta (\theta) \right)^2
\end{equation}

which is equivalent to:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_\theta (\theta) = \frac{D(\theta)}{\epsilon} * \sqrt {\frac{ \cos (\theta) ^2 \sin (\theta) ^2} {a_1^2 \cos (\theta)^{2\epsilon} \sin(\theta)^4 + a_2^2 \sin (\theta)^{2\epsilon} \cos(\theta)^4}}
\end{equation}

By setting $D(\theta)$ to a constant spatial sampling value, the incremental updates of the angular parameter are:

\begin{eqnarray}
&& \theta_i = \theta_{i-1} + \Delta_\theta (\theta_i) \textnormal{ , with } \theta_0 = 0 \textnormal{, and } i \in \{ 1 ... N \} \textnormal {, and } \theta_N < \pi / 2 \\
&& \theta_i = \theta_{i-1} - \Delta_\theta (\theta_i) \textnormal{ , with } \theta_0 = \pi/2 \textnormal{, and } i \in \{ 1 ... N \} \textnormal {, and } \theta_N > 0
\end{eqnarray}

There are singularities at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi/2$, so we need to treat them separately. When $\theta \rightarrow 0$, the superellipse can be approximated by:

\begin{equation}
x (\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \theta ^\epsilon \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

resulting in:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_\theta (\theta) = \left(\frac{D (\theta)}{a_2} - \theta^\epsilon \right)^{1/\epsilon} - \theta
\end{equation}

Similarly, for $\theta \rightarrow \pi/2$:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_\theta (\theta) = \left( \frac{D(\theta)}{a_1} - (\pi/2 - \theta)^\epsilon \right)^{1/\epsilon} - (\pi/2 - \theta)
\end{equation}

The final solution is to switch between the 3 branches depending on the current value of $\theta$.

What was described until now is applied to a single superellipse. In order to spatially sample a superquadric in a uniform way, we sample  one superellipse for $\epsilon_1$ and one for $\epsilon_2$ and then compute their spherical product (see Section \ref{sec:math} for details).
